# MailTime

MailTime is an app that digs into your GMail account in order to find some patterns within it. For now, MailTime is able to:

1. Show you when you recieve/send the most emails weekly/daily.
2. Show you the best time to send someone email. (TODO)

To run:

* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec guard`
* `rackup`
